# Traditional database

Traditional relational database are designed to organize alphanumeric data into interrelated collections. However, this technology is not well suited to the management of multimedia information. The feature vector data, vector storing and indexing methods, the large size of media objects are entirely foreign to traditional databases. 

Some may argue and request call our attention to some vector indexing plug-ins by traditional databases, such as imgsmlr by PostgreSQL and word2vector by Google. However, as the optimizations are only made based on hash-based search and one-dimention alphanumeirc data, the performance of these plug-ins are far from satisfying, and can barely meet the needs of huge high-dimentional vector indexing.
