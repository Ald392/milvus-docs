- Our roadmap is typically structured into three parts: the most recent release, the next upcoming release, and a mid-to-long term vision within the next year.
- As we progress, we continually learn and occasionally adjust our focus, adding or removing items as needed.
- These plans are indicative and subject to change, and may vary based on subscription services.
- We steadfastly adhere to our roadmap, with our [release notes](release_notes.md) serving as a reference.
