Milvus comes in two distributions: CPU-only Milvus and GPU-enabled Milvus.

<ul>
<li>CPU-only Milvus only supports using CPU to search or build index. 
</li> 
<li>GPU-enabled Milvus supports GPU acceleration for searching and index building: You can use CPU for searching and GPU for index building at the same time to improve query efficiency.</li>
</ul>

If your GPU supports CUDA, then you can install GPU-enabled Milvus to achieve much higher search performance in large-scale datasets.
