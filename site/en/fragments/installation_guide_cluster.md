This topic describes how to install Milvus cluster using Docker Compose, Kubernetes or Ansible Controller. On Kubernetes, you can choose either Helm or Milvus Operator to deploy a Milvus cluster.

If you run into image loading errors while installing, you can [Install Milvus Offline](install_offline-docker.md).

You can also build Milvus from source code at [GitHub](https://github.com/milvus-io/milvus#to-start-developing-milvus).
