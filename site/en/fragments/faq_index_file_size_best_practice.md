You need to set `index_file_size` when creating a collection from a client. This parameter specifies the size of each segment, and its default value is `1024` in MB. When the size of newly inserted vectors reaches the specified volume, Milvus packs these vectors into a new segment. In other words, newly inserted vectors do not go into a segment until they grow to the specified volume. When it comes to creating indexes, Milvus creates one index file for each segment. When conducting a vector search, Milvus searches all index files one by one.

As a rule of thumb, we would see a 30% ~ 50% increase in the search performance after changing the value of `index_file_size` from 1024 to 2048. Note that an overly large `index_file_size` value may cause failure to load a segment into the memory or graphics memory. Suppose the graphics memory is 2 GB and `index_file_size` 3 GB, each segment is obviously too large.

In situations where vectors are not frequently inserted, we recommend setting the value of `index_file_size` to 1024 MB or 2048 MB. Otherwise, we recommend setting the value to 256 MB or 512 MB to keep unindexed files from getting too large.
