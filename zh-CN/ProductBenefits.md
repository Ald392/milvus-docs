# 产品优势


## GPU加速搜索系统

Milvus针对大规模向量数据索引而设计。CPU/GPU异核计算让您的数据处理速度提高1000倍以上。 

拥有分布式数据存储和计算架构，您可以轻松The data is stored and computed on a distributed architecture. This lets you scale data sizes up and down without redesigning the system. 


## 智能索引，数据弹性伸缩

With a “Decide Your Own Algorithm” approach, you can embed machine learning and advanced algorithms into Milvus without the headache of complex data engineering or migrating data between disparate systems. 

Milvus is built on optimized indexing algorithm based on quantization indexing, tree-based and graph indexing methods. 


## 简单好用

With Milvus, you can focus on your feature vectors, rather than managing the systems. Data is ready for indexing immediately, with superior ad-hoc performance.

Installation is a breeze, and can be performed in a few minutes. Our Load-and-Go technology means Milvus can load up to 3TB/hour/GPU out-of-the-box.

The performance of system can be easily tracked on Prometheus-based GUI monitor dashboard.
