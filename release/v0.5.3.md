# What's New in v0.5.3

## 2019-11-14

### Bug fixes

- Solve bytes type in proto cause big-endian/little-endian problem

### Enhancements

- Doubled the transmission speed of search results to the client application through:
  
  - Optimizing gRPC messages; 
  - Changing the API of generated code of gRPC; 
  - Removing gRPC compression. 
  
- Enhance the search performance of `IVF_SQ8H`.

- Python SDK

  - Seperate the storage of `id` and `distance` in different arrays, which speeds up the API response time;
  - Add a new API to retrieve a specific target vector in search results: `id = results.id_array[i][j], distance = results.distance_array[i][j]`;
  - Add a new API for iterating over arrays, which takes much less time if `nq` and `topk` is large.
    ```
    >> for id_list, dis_list in zip(results.id_array, results.distance_array):
    >>     for id, dis in zip(id_list, dis_list):
    >>        print("id={}, distance={}".format(id, dis))
    ```

- Java SDK
 
  Add `keepalive` and `idleTimeout` settings when connecting to Milvus server.
