### Improvements
  
- **Milvus internal FAISS**

  In addition to original FAISS, Milvus has made deep optimizations to increase query performance and support more index types. Now this part of internal FAISS is open sourced.
  
- **Multiple GPU for index building**
 
  Support index building by multiple GPUs to reduce index building and overall query time. Specify the GPU devices for index building process in Milvus configuration parameter `build_index_resources`.
