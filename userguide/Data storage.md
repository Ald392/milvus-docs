# Data storage

Whenever new vector data is loaded into Milvus, they are automatically stored in 2 places: local hard drive and [MinIO private cloud](https://min.io/product/multi-cloud-gateway#multi-cloud-gateway). 

Keeping a copy of the data in the cloud ensures the completeness and accessibility of your data when indexed.
