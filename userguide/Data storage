# Data storage

Whenever new vector data is loaded into Milvus, they are automatically saved in 2 places: local disk and MinIO private cloud.

MinIO data storage infrastructure is compatible with Amazon S3. You can unify their data infrastructure - from file to block, all appearing as objects accessible via the Amazon S3 API without the requirement for migration.
