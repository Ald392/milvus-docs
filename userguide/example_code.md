# Try an Example Program

Now, let's run a Python example program. Assume you want to create a table, insert 10 vectors, and then run a vector similarity search.

1. Make sure [Python 3.4](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or higher is already installed and in use.

2. Install Milvus Python SDK.

   ```shell
   # Install Milvus Python SDK
   $ pip install pymilvus==0.2.0
   ```

   > Note: To learn more about Milvus Python SDK, go to [Milvus Python SDK Playbook](https://pypi.org/project/pymilvus). 

3. Create a new file `example.py`, and add [Python example code](https://github.com/milvus-io/pymilvus/blob/branch-0.4.0/examples/AdvancedExample.py) to it.

4. Run the example code.

   ```shell
   # Run Milvus Python example
   $ python3 example.py
   ```

5. Confirm the program is running correctly.

Congratulations! You have successfully completed your first vector similarity search with Milvus.
