# Product Benefits


## GPU-accelerated search engine

Milvus is designed for the largest scale of vector index. CPU/GPU heterogeneous computing architecture allows you to process data at a speed 1000 times faster. 

Our Load-and-Go technology means Milvus can load up to 3TB/hour/GPU out-of-the-box.


## Smart index, with high scalability

With a “Decide Your Own Algorithm” approach, you can embed machine learning and advanced algorithms into Milvus without the headache of complex data engineering or migrating data between disparate systems. 

Milvus is built on optimized indexing algorithm based on quantization indexing, tree-based and graph indexing methods. 

The data is stored and computed on a distributed architecture. This lets you scale data sizes up and down without redesigning the system. 


## Exceptional ease of use

With Milvus, you can focus on your feature vectors, rather than managing the systems. Data is ready for indexing immediately, with superior ad-hoc performance.

Installation is a breeze, and can be performed in a few minutes. The performance of system can be easily tracked on Prometheus-based GUI monitor dashboard.
